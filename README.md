# My neighborhood map
###### Going through js design using knockoutjs (MVVM), and some api (at least google map)

### What it does
Display a list of some location in my town and put them on the map.

You can search trough the list by typing in the search box, results will stay displayed on the map
Each marker have a description in InfoWindow.
Click them to see description and a random photo of that place provided by Flickr.

Clicking on the list element will center the map on it.
