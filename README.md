# JSDesignMap
Going through js design using knockoutjs (MVVM), and some api (at least google map)

Simple thinks are displayed here :
  - Google Map centered first on my house and some markers on the map
  - A list of my markers (clickable and which center the map on them)
  - A search bar to search marker by typing (hit Enter or click a list item will center the map on it)


TODO :

- A bit of styling on the page... Responsive !
- Adding some APIs, don't know which yet...
